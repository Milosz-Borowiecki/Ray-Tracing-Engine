# Ray-Tracing-Engine

This project is about Ray Tracing Engine from `Ray Tracing in One Weekend` series with a few changes.

Link to the whole book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)

I'm going to use several libraries to reduce code and learn some features included there. Also they will give me possibility to extern the engine in future.

## Setup

Open command and type:

```
vendor\premake5.exe vs2022
```

In the project directory.

This will create sln file.
